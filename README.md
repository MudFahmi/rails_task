Here is a [Link](https://youtu.be/AUkbb2kl9k4)

for a Video Testing the project Functionality/Methods 

```

```
1- Acess api  
```
Using api url "http://localhost:3000/api/products"
u can make CRUD actions (Create,Read,Update,Delete) for the products
i used postman software to run all requests and check the api 


```
2- Search by product name 
```
You can put your term for search in this url "http://localhost:3000/api/products/search?term=searched_word"


```
3- Create random data to seed in database
```
Using ```Faker Gem``` to put some data in database


```
4- Unit testing 
```
Using ```Rspec Gem``` to use it in testing producs_controller.rb 
I create all "Example Group" but can not run it 

I tried to find another way to solve it , but I can't for now ( Still trying )

```
Overall used Gems ( two gems )

1-faker gem
2-rspec gem

```
